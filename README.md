# âš¡ Projects

### Gender Disparity Project Summer 2023
As a 2023 [Equitech Scholar](https://www.equitechfutures.com/program/esp) I have worked on a data analysis project that delved into understanding the relationship between the perception of gender in societies across the world in 74 countries across 10 years, and its relationship to women's participation in parliament, economy and more. As part of this project I have self studied python for data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib etc.
### Budget Bites
As part of [A Ticket For Your Future](https://www.arcelikglobal.com/en/company/human-resources/a-ticket-for-your-future/) 2023 program that is led by a global and a prominent Turkish company, Arcelik (Beko) Global, I worked on a conceptual project that utilizes machine learning, behavioral analysis and cloud computing principles to bring nearly expiring groceries in chain markets to kitchen with fellow students. 
### Object-oriented Programming 
[RentIt](https://github.com/irem-naz/RentIt): Home rental system, with full fledged renter and rentee interface coded using *C++* language with object oriented programming principles such as polymorphism.
### Interactive Media in Experiences and Games 
[Self/Love](https://github.com/irem-naz/Self-Love): An interactive experience of love for another that strips the person's own self-love away facilitated through the experience of 3 distinct rooms created in *P5.JS*.

[The Journey](https://editor.p5js.org/iremnaz/full/pTepSSWgy): This is an interactive storytelling experience that is facilitated through Arduino and P5JS. The pressure sensors are placed under 5 segments of a circle placed on the floor where the participant uses an iPad to receive the visual response to their steps/journey on the circle. The audio accompaniment also exists. This experience digs into the 5 stages of a Hero's Journey by making it relatable and connected to our everyday lives through simple allegories, and carries the participant through its story.

[Battleship](https://github.com/irem-naz/Battleship): battleship game leisure design using *Python*.


### M5Stack and Arduino Physical Computing
[StesStrap](https://github.com/irem-naz/StresStrap): A strap that is coded on *Arduino IDE* for stress management where the user is asked to rate their current situation, and accordingly different attention tests are prompted. Depending on the results, information for contacts and aid videos are prompted on user's phone through *Bluetooth*.
