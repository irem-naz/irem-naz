# ðŸ’¬ About me
My name is Irem Naz Celen, and I recently graduated with major in Computer Engineering and minoring in Interactive Media at New York University Abu Dhabi. My interest areas currently lie in physical computing and interactive installations, machine learning, and software development, with a social focus on female health, women's representation in STEM, and mindfulness. I'm always ready to take on new endeavors! For example, I'm currently learning in studio and outside professional filmmaking!

**Relevant Classes:** *open source software engineering, introduction to machine learning, computer organization and architecture, operating systems, data structures and algorithms, oop, cinematography, introduction to interactive media and more!*
